    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from them can have. OOP allows for modular, reusable, and scalable code by organizing software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. The main principles of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of the object and only exposing a controlled interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This simplifies interaction with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: A mechanism to create a new class that is based on an existing class. The new class, called a derived or child class, inherits attributes and methods from the base or parent class, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types). Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class."
